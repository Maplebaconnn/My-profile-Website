<b>What these tests mean for me:</b>
<p>
In a general sense, these tests are shockingly accurate from this experience. They have highlighted general strengths and weaknesses of my personality and allowed me to consider options and then develop methods to adapting to other personality types in encounters and dealing with my own weaknesses when working independently. This will allow me to grow and become more agile in professional and unprofessional environments.
In the Myers-Briggs Test I completed my resulting personality type was INFP-T Mediator. INFP-T Mediator personality types are known to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>Be loyal, upbeat, and considerate. </li>
	<li>They tend to be friendly and optimistic </li>
	<li>They value equality, fairness and enjoy helping others. </li>
	<li>Mediators often search for and enjoy creative endeavours and love to imagine things from unconventional perspectives.</li>
	<li>Be mostly introvert personalities</li>
	<li>Known for great empathy and listening </li>
	<li>Mediators do not excel at organising and tend to be disorganised, uncareful and not diligent </li>
	<li>Known to not take criticism well if delivered harshly. </li>
</ul>
<p>
The Big Five Personality test would echo similar results with the Myers-Briggs test. The results show:
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Further support by low conscientiousness scores in factor 4 (Conscientiousness) </li>
	<li>Further support to introvert type Factor 1 </li>
	<li>Further support creativity and imagination abilities as key indicators of INFP-T mediators Factor 5 </li>
</ul>
<p>
The Learning Style Test indicates what type of learning materials a learner would best respond to. According to the Learning styles test I am a visual learner who learns best from reading or seeing pictures. 
</p>
<p>
<b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b>
</p>
<p>
While working on group projects I’ll be able to innovate creative solutions to issues which will be helpful when the team comes across any problems. As a colleague I’ll bring a sense of harmony to the team and steer away from conflict. I am known to be a supportive team player who will pitch in to help someone without any expectation of praise. I’ll engage in collaboration and enjoy working with others, value everyone’s input and actively contribute my own ideas. As a visual learner who learns best from reading or seeing pictures, I will be able to understand complex ideas from others if they provide a demonstration if this is not possible, I will need to take notes which will help with re-call and to process information.  
In a team setting I would benefit from clear roles, expectations and set deadlines to keep myself on track and accountable to team deliverables, this is something I will need to openly discuss with the team. My personality type tends to not take criticism well if delivered too harshly depending on the personality types I am paired with this may create some tension which I will need to monitor. It’s important that I see criticism as an opportunity to grow.
</p>
<p>
<b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b>
</p>
<p>
When forming a team, it will be critical to identify complimentary personality types and learning styles that will work well with my strengths and support some of my weaknesses. The ability to leverage the organisational, detail orientated skills of other personality types would help to address some of the possible shortfalls in my personality type. 
For example, INFP and ISFJ both have similar strengths in that they are both known to be warm and helpful. 
However, ISFJ’s are known to be very organised, and detail oriented which is a trait lacking in INFP. Finding fellow visual learners will likely mean they will present ideas in a way that suits my learning style. It will be important to note there will likely be personalities I am not cohesive with and although working with these individuals will not be impossible it would not be an optimal choice. For example, as I tend to not respond well to harsh criticism a colleague who scores low agreeableness scores may not be the most ideal teammate.
