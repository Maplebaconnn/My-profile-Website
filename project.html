		<h1>Project Idea</h1>
	</div>
<b>Overview</b>
	<p>
		My proposal will be an Application (App) and an accompanying collar/lead both targeted at assisting dog owners with training their dogs humanly and effectively.  The App will house several training resources including verified direct support from trainers and social aspects. The App will also be connected to a specially engineered training collar and lead system. The collar and lead are designed to target negative behaviours exhibited while walking your dog’s using inbuilt deterrents designed to create a distraction and allow an opportunity for the dog walker to easily provide guidance. The deterrent can be set off manually or by the sensors in the lead designed to register when a dog is pulling. 
	</p>
	
<b>Motivation</b>
<p>
The pet industry is booming with approximately 61% of households in Australia owning a pet (RSPCA, 2018). Pet owners are spending $12.2 billion in Australia annually, with a projected growth of 2.8 billion by 2026 (Pets and the Pandemic, n.d.). The pet services market which includes training has been the fastest-growing segment over the 5 years and is predicted to climb over the next few years post COVID-19 (Roberts, 2021).  The recent lockdowns and working from home dogs have resulted in dogs who are not being adequately socialized or adjusted to normal routines resulting increase in fear-based behaviours, separation anxiety, and several other behavioural issues (Today’s Veterinary Practice, 2021). Evidence based suggestions to improve behavioural issues include seeking professional trainers and using training tools such as lemon water spray (Staff, 2019), and training whistles (Dogtime, 2019). My App and accompanying product will be targeted at tapping into this growing industry by leveraging evidence-based knowledge on effective training methods and products. 
</p>
<b>Description</b>
<p>The app is a training platform designed for dogs of all ages, owners can use the app to teach their dog several things including tricks, how to walk, potty train, and much more via informative training videos prepared by qualified trainers. The app can also be accessed to receive advice from paid professionals either via a forum or by video call. Video calls will allow the owner to access real-time help and allow the trainer to observe the behaviour firsthand and provide tailored advice. Along with training resources, there will also be several social aspects built into the app including forums where pet owners can discuss training issues, or anything related to their pets. There will also be a calendar of events which will include trainer lead group meetups where dog owners can receive advice from trainers and have their dog practice socializing with pet owners who also need help. This will be especially helpful to dog owners who may be avoiding social settings with their dogs due to judgment from other pet owners or from fear their pets may be uncontrollable while out. Having small groups supervised by trainers will allow a safe and judgment-free area where owners and dogs can learn together.  The app will also hold the settings for the collar and lead as well as reporting features based on usage. The app will house the following functionality: 
<ul>
	<li>Dog Training video library resource Paid/Unpaid </li>
	<li>Discussion forums with real, qualified dog trainers to answer questions as well as community discussions</li>
	<li>Functionality to house video calls with trainers for specific advice</li>
	<li>notifications about public meetups supervised by trainers</li>
	<li>provisions for social media platform and expansion</li>
	<li>settings for the collar/lead </li>
	<li>reports based on usage data of the app and collar which will be used to make training recommendations</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The collar and lead are designed to create purposeful distractions to create an opportunity for the dog walker to easily provide proper guidance to correct undesirable behaviours. This is achieved by the release of deterrents including either the activation of a loud high pitch whistle only heard by dogs or the release of a strong-smelling lemon solution both released from the collar. The lead will be targeted towards reducing pulling on the lead and will include a sensor designed to trigger a deterrent once there is significant tension on the lead. Once released the dog will be distracted and the owner can take necessary actions to remove the stressor or correct behaviour. 
<ul>
	<li>Deterrents can be activated by the owner via app</li>
	<li>Deterrent can also be activated when sensors are alerted to tension on the lead</li>
	<li>There are adjustable settings in the app. The owner can set what deterrent is activated, the sensitivity of sensors, and the length of the activation (whistle or spray length).</li> 
</ul>
</p>
<b>Tools and Technologies:</b> 
<p>
Tools and technologies needed for this project are:
<ul>
	<li>The programming for the lead will be done with Python (Bluetooth interconnectivity and deterrent regulation programs)</li>
	<li>The software will be developed using C#, Kotlin and Swift</li>
	<li>Main app to be developed with Kotlin and Swift</li>
	<li>The deterrent canister will need to be created or sourced as well as the spray</li>
	<li>The dog whistle be an electronic speaker</li>
	<li>The collar will need to be designed and a prototype created</li>
	<li>The lead handle is an established design, this can be reused once one is found with an open-source schematic found and the lead itself can be sourced easily from manufacturers.</li>
	<li>Sensors to be sourced.</li>
	<li>Software legalities and administration requirements to be sourced via consultation</li>
	<li>Manufacturing of the product to be sourced</li>
	<li>Rechargeable battery to be sourced</li>
</ul>
</p>
<b>Skills Required:</b>
<p>
The skills required for this project to be complete will be:
<ul>
	<li>Software development (C#, Kotlin, Swift and Python) and consultation (administration)</li>
	<li>Electrical engineering (assembly schematic and creation including power requirements)</li>
	<li>Mechanical engineering (to source/develop deterrent canister and system)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
All these skills are readably hireable in the labour market and can be accessed through several supply channels, for example, labour supply office (recruiter) or online postings (Fiverr).
Other skills required for the project will be planning and designing the product and capabilities. This will come from the design team.
